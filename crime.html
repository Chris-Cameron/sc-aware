                    Here in South Carolina, we boast the highest violent crime rate in the United States of America,
                    as well as the 2nd highest in property crime rate (second only to Washington, D.C. which isnâ€™t even a state).

                    This is perhaps connected to our ridiculously skewed distribution of wealth.
                    According to a 2006 study from the Strom Thurmond Institute providing analysis on the South Carolina-US income gap, over 25% of households in Allendale,SC made less than $10,000 annually in 2000.
                    In the same year, only 12% of households in Greenville,SC made less than $10,000 annually.
                    Below are two different maps of South Carolina, the left displaying the median household income per household per county and the right displaying the crime rate per county.
                    With some exceptions, such as Williamsburg and Horry county, it is clear that lower median income correlates to a higher crime rate for a given county.
