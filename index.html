            Salutations! Welcome to the grandiose train wreck that is our Palmetto State!
            To learn more about why we have the highest number of violent crimes, visit our Crime section. 
            For everything wondrously awful about South Carolinaâ€™s inconsistent weather and consistently unpleasant humidity,
            be sure to check out the Weather section. Wanting information on our joke of a educational system? The Education section is the place to explore!
            If you were looking to feed pigeons, you should have stayed in New York. Check out the Wildlife section to learn about our wildlife, or rather, the lack fo it.
            Finally, before you experience in-person the dastardly conditions of the roads here, be sure to check out our Infrastructure section to know just how awful the roads really are. 
            Here at Do Not Visit South Carolina we intend to raise awareness that, no matter what reason(s) to visit or live in South Carolina there may be,
            going to South Carolina is an absolutely ridiculous idea. We offer more insight into the worst qualities of this deplorable state than any of our potential competitors.
