            In 2017, South Carolina's infrastructture recieved a grade of <a class = "body" href = "https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/state-item/south-carolina/"> D+ </a> from the Infrastructure Report Card in 2017. This may be partially a result of 10.3% of the bridges being structurally deficient.
            This may sound low, but keep in mind that these bridges may collapse at any time, blocking off transportation and endagnering those travelling over them.
            Furthermore, South Carolina has a whopping 178 dams that have a "high-hazard potential", creating an unnecessary flood risk in various parts of the state.
