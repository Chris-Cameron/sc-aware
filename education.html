          To say that South Carolina is lacking in the education department would be a severe understatement; not only was South Carolina ranked dead last (50th; Washington, D.C. was not included in the survey) in a 2017 U.S. News & World Report study, but South Carolina also ranks low in overall political activism. A low rank in political activism along with already deplorable educational systems means that education will be below average for a considerable duration of time as of right now.
